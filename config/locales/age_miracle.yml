    heading: Innovative active ingredients
    main: Leucojum Aestivum bulb extract <br/>
      An absolute innovation in anti-ageing research! Rather than speeding up the skin’s 
      cell division, as is the case with other products, the so-called ‘dormins’ extracted 
      from the Summer snowflake, reduce the speed of cell division. This extract offers 
      the sought-after effects of slowing down the skin’s ageing process, improving its 
      elasticity and noticeably reducing the depth of wrinkles. <br/>
      Paracress extract <br/>
      Extensive tests have shown that this extract relaxes the facial muscles, which 
      has a distinct wrinkle-improving effect. This was confirmed by 75% of the test 
      participants after only a day’s use. 83% of the testers also confirmed a significant 
      reduction in “crow’s feet”. Relaxed facial features correspond to fewer wrinkles 
      and a younger-looking skin.<br/> 
      Centella asiatica extract <br/>
      This organic extract stimulates the production of the skin’s own collagen and has 
      a significant influence on the skin’s elasticity and toning of the facial outline. <br/>
      Hyaluronic acid <br/>
      This powerful active agent is isolated from wheat. Hyaluronic acid is, in fact,
      produced by the skin itself. However, by the age of 35, its production gradually decreases.
      Hyaluronic acid is capable of binding water to skin cells, thus increasing 
      the elasticity of the skin. <br/>
      Natural scents <br/>
      According to aromatherapeutic principles, a mixture of essential oils, isolated 
      from iris and attar of roses, supports the regenerating effect.<br/>
