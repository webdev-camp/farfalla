        Orinoco nut and Brazilian pepper tree <br/>
        With its high-quality Omega-3 fatty acids, the Orinoco nut has a positive influence 
        on the release of the happiness hormone, dopamine. The Brazilian pepper tree
        also promotes the secretion of this hormone. Among other positive traits, dopamine 
        improves blood circulation, giving you a more radiant appearance and that 
        special “newly in love” appeal. In order to give your skin the necessary positive impulses, 
        use it when you want to pamper yourself or in stressful situations during
        a strenuous work day or when travelling. Feeling at ease with yourself and good 
        about your appearance will enhance your radiance even further. <br/>

        The subtle shimmer effect conceals small blemishes and wrinkles. <br/>
        Natural scents <br/>

        from vanilla, cocoa and bergamot, contributes towards the «bliss effect» of this 
        line of products. <br/>
