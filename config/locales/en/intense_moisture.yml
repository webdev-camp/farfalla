    header: Innovative active ingredients
    main: <p>Resurrection plant <br/>
      This plant grows in desert conditions and, even when dried out, has the unique
      ability to expand into a lush flowering plant after absorbing only a small amount
      of moisture. The resurrection plant has the same effect on the skin! It contains an 
      exceptional substance which can restructure denatured enzymes and optimise 
      the skin’s self-protection. In just one week, the skin’s texture is already improved 
      and the complexion looks visibly refined. <br/>
      <p>Hyaluronic acid <br/>
      This powerful active agent is isolated from wheat. Hyaluronic acid is, in fact,
      produced by the skin itself. However, by the age of 35, its production gradually decreases.
      Hyaluronic acid is capable of binding water to skin cells, thus increasing
      the elasticity of the skin. <br/>
      <p>Aloe vera <br/>
      The organic fresh plant extract, isolated from the Aloe vera leaf, supports cell
      regeneration, thanks to its rich abundance of minerals, enzymes, trace elements 
      and vitamins. Aloe vera refills the skin’s moisture depots and, as a result, the skin 
      is firmed and wrinkles softened. <br/>
      <p>Macadamia <br/>
      This organic nut oil, with its exceptional fatty acid spectrum, is highly effective at
      smoothing and regenerating skin. It gives the complexion a velvety-soft touch and
      intensively nourishes the skin. <br/>
