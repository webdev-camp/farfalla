    sub_header: "The new premium line in the Crystal Balance® range "
    list: "This innovative product line draws its wide-ranging efficacy from the light-bringing qualities of amber.
          The stone’s energy, as with the other oils in the Crystal Balance® range, 
          is harnessed for skincare by a special maceration, and supported by a finely tuned blend 
          of organic essential oils. Amber gemstone oil and moisturising cream lend the complexion 
          a new radiance and are especially effective for skin with bad blood circulation, and for 
          tired and sallow skin. Fruity, fresh aromas of mandarin and bergamot, combined with warming 
          essences of benzoin, ginger and vanilla, warm the heart and impart a feeling of security.<br/>
          
          Certified organic cosmetic with 95% organic ingredients – 3 stars NaTrue. 
          Without artificial scents, preservatives or paraffines. 
          We do not use polyethylene glycol or paraffines. Farfalla is against animal testing."
