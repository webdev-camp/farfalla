    main: Linseed extract <br/>
          A fantastic plant substance that controls oily and/or blemished skin, leaving a 
          refreshingly clean and clear appearance. Test results showed a positive reduction 
          in sebum production, as well as the alleviation of minor skin damage. 
          Hamamelis water <br/>
          This organic herbal toner, with its pore-refining and slightly anti-inflammatory
          effect, helps to clear blemished skin. <br/>
          Aloe vera <br/>
          The organic fresh plant extract, isolated from the Aloe vera leaf, supports cell 
          regeneration, thanks to its rich abundance of minerals, enzymes, trace elements 
          and vitamins. Aloe vera refills the skin’s moisture depots and, as a result, the skin 
          is firmed and wrinkles softened. <br/>
          Natural scents <br/>
          According to aromatherapeutic principles, a mixture of essential oils isolated from 
          organic-quality cistus, manuka, rosemary and sage, works specifically against skin 
          impurities. With its deep-penetrating effect, the skin is sustainably cleansed and 
          balanced sebum production supported.<br/>
