    heading: Innovative active ingredients
    main: Quillaja <br/>
          The prized organic Quillaja saponin is isolated from the bark of the South American 
            soap bark tree, Quillaja saponaria. The active substances contained in this 
            organic raw material are particularly suited to facial cleansing. Folk medicine has 
            also made use of this saponin-containing bark for many years. <br/>
          Aloe Vera <br/>
            The organic fresh plant extract, isolated from the Aloe vera leaf, supports cell 
            regeneration, thanks to its rich abundance of minerals, enzymes, trace elements 
            and vitamins. Aloe vera dispenses moisture with the result that the skin becomes 
            firmer and wrinkles are reduced and softened. <br/>
          Natural scents with deep-penetrating effect <br/>
            Organic essential oils such as grapefruit, lemon grass, rosemary, lemon and mint, 
            selected in accordance with aromatherapy principles, vitalise the skin and support 
            the deep-penetrating effect of the plant extracts.<br/>
