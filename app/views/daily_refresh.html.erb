  <p><strong>I</strong><strong>nnovative active ingredients </strong></p>
  <p>Quillaja 
    The prized organic Quillaja saponin is isolated from the bark of the South American 
    soap bark tree, Quillaja saponaria. The active substances contained in this 
    organic raw material are particularly suited to facial cleansing. Folk medicine has 
    also made use of this saponin-containing bark for many years. 
  </p>
  <p>Aloe Vera 
    The organic fresh plant extract, isolated from the Aloe vera leaf, supports cell 
    regeneration, thanks to its rich abundance of minerals, enzymes, trace elements 
    and vitamins. Aloe vera dispenses moisture with the result that the skin becomes 
    firmer and wrinkles are reduced and softened. 
  </p>
  <p>Natural scents with deep-penetrating effect 
    Organic essential oils such as grapefruit, lemon grass, rosemary, lemon and mint, 
    selected in accordance with aromatherapy principles, vitalise the skin and support 
    the deep-penetrating effect of the plant extracts.</p>
