                  <p>Quillaja <br>
                    The prized organic Quillaja saponin is isolated from the bark of the South American <br>
                    soap bark tree, Quillaja saponaria. The active substances contained in this <br>
                    organic raw material are particularly suited to facial cleansing. Folk medicine has <br>
                    also made use of this saponin-containing bark for many years. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Aloe Vera <br>
                    The organic fresh plant extract, isolated from the Aloe vera leaf, supports cell <br>
                    regeneration, thanks to its rich abundance of minerals, enzymes, trace elements <br>
                    and vitamins. Aloe vera dispenses moisture with the result that the skin becomes <br>
                    firmer and wrinkles are reduced and softened. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Natural scents with deep-penetrating effect <br>
                    Organic essential oils such as grapefruit, lemon grass, rosemary, lemon and mint, <br>
                    selected in accordance with aromatherapy principles, vitalise the skin and support <br>
                    the deep-penetrating effect of the plant extracts.</p>
