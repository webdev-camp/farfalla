  Effective – thanks to innovative plant ingredients <br/>
    These sophisticated formulas are based on innovative, active plant ingredients,
    all of which have been thoroughly tested for their effectiveness. Wherever possible, 
    only ingredients of certified organic origin are used. This highly-developed 
    product range offers a solution for the individual care needs of every type and 
    property of skin. <br/>
  <br/>
  Effective – thanks to organic vegetable oils <br/>
    Highly valuable, cold-pressed and unadulterated vegetable oils of the very best 
    organic quality are rich in natural active ingredients. Thanks to the smooth interplay 
    of a diversity of components, the skin is cared for in a holistic way. <br/>
  <br/>
  Effective – thanks to mountain spring water and floral waters. <br/>
Instead of tap-water, our products contain floral waters of organic quality and 
    mountain spring water drawn from a certified mineral spring, situated at 2470 
    metres above sea level in the Swiss Alps.<br/>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <strong>Farfalla 
    sets standards </strong>
  <strong>0% Mineral oils </strong><br/>
    Mineral oils form a film on the skin which can hinder the skin’s respiratory activity 
    and possibly plug the pores. Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients, 
  therefore, use only valuable and highly-effective organic vegetable oils. <br/>
<strong>0% Synthetic substances </strong><br/>
  Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients use only natural essential oils
    as fragrances and active ingredients. Wherever possible, essential oils of certified 
    organic origin are added. The exclusive use of natural preservatives guarantees
    the excellent sustainability of the products. Since colorants do not increase the 
  value of products, Farfalla has completely refrained from their addition. <br/>
<strong>0% Silicone or polyethylene glycol (PEG) </strong><br/>
  We comply fully with the standards in the natural cosmetics industry and use
    neither silicone nor polyethylene glycol in our products. These additives could 
  lead to skin or general health problems if applied to the skin regularly. <br/>
<strong>No animal testing </strong><br/>
  Farfalla products are not animal-tested. Farfalla has never taken part in animal experiments
  and has never asked any third party to act on their behalf in this regard. <br/>
     <strong>No adverse reactions </strong><br/>
    All products have been clinically and dermatologically-tested (Dermatest) and 
    have been awarded the top classification of “Very Good”. This means that not a 
  single person showed any adverse reactions to the products. <br/>
<strong>NaTrue </strong><br/>
  Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients are certified in accordance
    with the NaTrue certification of organic and natural cosmetics. NaTrue makes the
  following distinctions: <br/>
  Level 1: Natural cosmetics which correspond to the present Bundesverband <br/>
    Deutscher Industrie und Handelsunternehmen (BDIH ) standards. <br/>
    Level 2: Natural cosmetics with organic ingredients – at least 70% organic <br/>
    ingredients. <br/>
  Level 3: Organic cosmetics – at least 95% organic ingredients <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 80% of the Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients comply 
    with Level 3 (Organic Cosmetics) requirements, two products comply with the 
    Level 2 (Natural Cosmetics ) requirements, and one product is listed as “Natural 
  Cosmetics”. <br/>
  <strong>Fair Trade </strong><br/>
    Since the very beginning, it has been a part of Farfalla’s philosophy to know the
    manufacturers and cooperatives producing the Fair Trade raw materials we import
    from over 40 countries worldwide. Through advance-financing, Farfalla helps to 
    support small-scale projects that were initiated and are growing according to the 
  philosophy and heartfelt endeavours of the people behind them. <br/>
  <strong>Eco-Packaging</strong><br/>
    Containers (jars or bottles). 
    <br/>
    The best protection for a product is a container (jar or bottle) made of glass. This is 
    why we market these valuable Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients in glass
    jars or bottles. Another positive aspect is that glass can be recycled without any
    problems. Other packages in use are airless tubes and tubes made of recyclable
  plastics. <br/>
  Outer packaging <br/>
    Outer packaging is necessary to protect the glass containers as much as possible. 
    We also use it to convey important print information in various languages. The
    ecological aspects are not overlooked either: The cardboard we use consists of 
    100% sustainable FSC certified cardboard.  <b><br/>
