  <strong>Farfalla sets standards </strong>
  <strong>0% Mineral oils </strong><br/>
    Mineral oils form a film on the skin which can hinder the skin’s respiratory activity 
    and possibly plug the pores. Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients, 
    therefore, use only valuable and highly-effective organic vegetable oils. <br/> 
  <strong>0% Synthetic substances </strong><br/>
    Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients use only natural essential oils
    as fragrances and active ingredients. Wherever possible, essential oils of certified 
    organic origin are added. The exclusive use of natural preservatives guarantees
    the excellent sustainability of the products. Since colorants do not increase the 
    value of products, Farfalla has completely refrained from their addition. <br/>
  <strong>0% Silicone or polyethylene glycol (PEG) </strong><br/>
    We comply fully with the standards in the natural cosmetics industry and use
    neither silicone nor polyethylene glycol in our products. These additives could 
    lead to skin or general health problems if applied to the skin regularly. <br/>
  <strong>No animal testing </strong><br/>
    Farfalla products are not animal-tested. Farfalla has never taken part in animal experiments
    and has never asked any third party to act on their behalf in this regard. <br/>
  <strong>No adverse reactions </strong><br/>
    All products have been clinically and dermatologically-tested (Dermatest) and 
    have been awarded the top classification of “Very Good”. This means that not a 
    single person showed any adverse reactions to the products. <br/>
  <strong>NaTrue </strong><br/>
    Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients are certified in accordance
    with the NaTrue certification of organic and natural cosmetics. NaTrue makes the
    following distinctions: <br/>
    Level 1: Natural cosmetics which correspond to the present Bundesverband <br/>
    Deutscher Industrie und Handelsunternehmen (BDIH ) standards. <br/>
    Level 2: Natural cosmetics with organic ingredients – at least 70% organic <br/>
    ingredients. <br/>
    Level 3: Organic cosmetics – at least 95% organic ingredients <br/>
    <br/>
    More than 80% of the Farfalla Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients comply 
    with Level 3 (Organic Cosmetics) requirements, two products comply with the 
    Level 2 (Natural Cosmetics ) requirements, and one product is listed as “Natural 
    Cosmetics”. <br/>
  <strong>Fair Trade </strong><br/>
    Since the very beginning, it has been a part of Farfalla’s philosophy to know the
    manufacturers and cooperatives producing the Fair Trade raw materials we import
    from over 40 countries worldwide. Through advance-financing, Farfalla helps to 
    support small-scale projects that were initiated and are growing according to the 
    philosophy and heartfelt endeavours of the people behind them. <br/>
  <strong>Eco-Packaging</strong><br/>
    Containers (jars or bottles). 
    <br/>
    The best protection for a product is a container (jar or bottle) made of glass. This is 
    why we market these valuable Organic Cosmetics with Active Ingredients in glass
    jars or bottles. Another positive aspect is that glass can be recycled without any
    problems. Other packages in use are airless tubes and tubes made of recyclable
    plastics. <br/>
    Outer packaging <br/>
    Outer packaging is necessary to protect the glass containers as much as possible. 
    We also use it to convey important print information in various languages. The
    ecological aspects are not overlooked either: The cardboard we use consists of 
    100% sustainable FSC certified cardboard.
